## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application will provide users a way to easily track their exercises, providing them with a way to track progress and focus on particular elements of their workout.
The need for this app comes from a lack of a quick and easy way to log and track exercises.  There are many applications that can achieve this, however most are in the realm of being overly complicated. 
### Features
1. User login/user profile: Users can log in to his or her profile, each user will have a profile page.
2. Location tracking: Workout sessions can be tracked by location, providing a better sense of reference for the user.
3. Dashboard view: Users can view their workout sessions and individual exercises in a dashboard type view, which will allow the user to see their exercise data in a graphical format and allow for them to quickly analyze progress or potential focus points. 
### Technologies
* Java
* Spring Boot
* JPA
* JavaScript (possibly React, and an additional "dashboard" library)
* HTML5
* Google Maps API


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to bridge the back end of my application to the front end (JS/React if necessary), how to use Google Maps API with Java, and how to implement any libraries I may need for my dashboard feature.
